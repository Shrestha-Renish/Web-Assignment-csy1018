			<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
			<p><i>Hello! My name is Renish Jayana Shrestha. I'm a BSc(Hons) Computing student here at NAMI college, Nepal, and this is the final report about my portfolio website
			that I created for my Term-I assignment of Web Development. I'll be sharing my thought process, the design decisions, difficulties that I faced while making my website
			and I'll also reference the Youtube videos and the websites that helped me during this journey.</i></p>
		</div><br><br>
		<!--Listing out the objectives of this assignment-->
		<div class="Objectives">
			<h2> Objectives </h2><br>
			<ul>
				<li>To show my HTML and CSS skills</li>
				<li>To create a simple website worthy of being a portfolio website</li>
				<li>To learn how to properly use GitHub</li>
				<li>To learn how to make web pages responsive</li>
			</ul>
		</div><br><br>
		<!--Sharing my Experience while building this website-->
		<div class="Experience">
			<h2>My Experience</h2><br>
			<p><i>My personal experience while building this website was both fun and frustrating at the same time. There would be times where I would be having fun discovering
			so many new tags and the various possibilities they could create, but when certain things didn't work as I planned, I would get really frustrated.<br><br>
			I would be lying if I said this was an easy assignment. Half the time I didn't know what to do and the other half I would just be there staring at my code thinking
			where did I mess up. YouTube and W3 schools helped me a ton throughout this whole process. If it wasn't for Youtube, I probably wouldn't have been able to complete this
			assignment in time that's for sure.<br><br> To be honest for the first 3-4 weeks I just made the basic HTML file for all the pages and left it like that because I was neither motivated nor was I able to ask my mentor Mr. Ankit Thapa for any kind of help due to this whole corona pandemic. I honestly wasted a lot of time but thankfully I was
			able to come in clutch with the help of Youtube.<br><br> I also learned a lot about various html and CSS tag and how to properly use Github throughout this whole journey.
			At first I thought there's no way I could do this, but once I put my mind into it, it honestly was way fun to learn even though it was confusing at times.</i></p>

		<!--Explaining my design decisions-->
		<div class="design">
			<h2>Design Decisions</h2><br>
			<p><i>I went for a simple and minimalistic design. I wasn't necessarily inspired by any website. I just made use of what I found from Youtube tutorials and made it my own.
			The main color for my website though is black without a doubt, just because I like black.</i></p>
